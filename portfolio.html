            <h3>Implementation and analysis of virtual mouse with hand gesture control</h3>
            <p>As technology is advancing rapidly in recent years, certain improvisations need to be made to keep up with the pace.People are exhausted from using mouse and touch pad. We have made a virtual mouse that can be used to control our system without even touching it.We will be utilizing the OpenCV library to implement our project. OpenCV is an extensive open-source library for machine learning,image processing and more.OpenCV supports many programming languages like C,Java,Python and more.The system can analyze images and videos to detect objects, faces, or even human handwriting.In this project, we will utilize the live feed from the webcam to create a virtual mouse with various functionalities.We will initially identify the landmarks of the hand and then trace clicks based on these points. We will also use smoothing techniques to make it more practical.We can perform all mouse functions through hand gestures, hence the name virtual mouse.</p>

            <h3>Detection of phishing attacks using machine learning</h3>
            <p>Phishing is a type of digital assault, which adversely affects people where the client is coordinated to counterfeit sites and hoodwinked to screen their touchy and private data which integrates watchwords of records, monetary data, ATM pin-card data, etc. Recently safeguarding touchy records, it's fragile to cover yourself from malware or web phishing. AI is an investigation of information examination and logical investigation of calculations has demonstrated outcomes. Contradicting phishing sprinters with remarkable perception and felonious outcomes comparable as care shops, and custom against phishing approaches. This paper examines the association of Machine Literacy routes in identifying phishing assaults and records their advantages and drawbacks. There are countless Machine Learning calculations that have been dug to proclaim the relevant decision that act as against phishing apparatuses. We made a phishing section framework that extracts capacities that are expected to descry phishing. We likewise utilize numeric outline, as well as an overall investigation of customary Machine Learning methodologies comparable as Decision Tree, Random Forest, Multi-layer Perceptronâ€™s, XG Boost Classifier, SVM, Light BGM Classifier, Cat Boost Classifier, and covering grounded highlights choice, which contains the metadata of URLs and assists with deciding if a site is licit or not.</p>
